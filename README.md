### Why data architecture? 

The data and analytics industry is currently worth more than $274 billion and skilled data architects are vital to designing the infrastructure businesses need to efficiently store, process, and analyze data. A successful enterprise today needs a data management system that aligns with business processes, scales with business growth, and adapts to technological changes and data architects play a critical role.

In this nanodegree program, I learned how to turn business requirements into the blueprints for enterprise data management systems.

Throughout this program, I learned how to:
- design and build a relational database
- create big data warehouse solutions in Snowflake,
- implement data lake architecture that supports big data processing.
