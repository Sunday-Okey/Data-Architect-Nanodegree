# Project: Human Resources Database Design





## Project Overview

In this project, I designed, built, and populated a database for the Human Resources (HR) Department at the imaginary Tech ABC Corp, a video game company. This project starts off with a request from the HR Manager. From there,I designed a database using the foundational principals of data architecture that is best suited to the department's needs. I went through all the steps of database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams (ERD), and finally creating the database itself. This project is important, as it is a scaled-down simulation of the kind of real-world assignments data architects work on every day.

## Business Scenario

### Business requirement

Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with its new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having trouble keeping up with the growth since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has become increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands.

As such, the HR department has tasked me to design and build a database capable of managing their employee information.


## Dataset
The [HR dataset](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f2452ca_hr-dataset/hr-dataset.xlsx) is an Excel workbook consisting of 205 records, with 15 columns. The data is in human-readable format and has not been normalized at all. The data lists the names of employees at Tech ABC Corp, as well as information such as job title, department, manager's name, hire date, start date, end date, work location, and salary.
